			'It has been a great pleasure to work with Jon for the past 8 months. I was directly involved in the day-to-day interaction with him when I was the CTO of Nowigence. Jon is a diligent developer with excellent project management, communication, and technical skills. He is also attentive to all sorts of technical issues and challenges we encountered during product development and maintenance. I felt much more confident when Jon is working on my team! Keep up the great work!'

			'Jon\'s leadership at Nowigence was unparalleled in my time there.  Jon exemplifies the mindset of "to lead by example".  It was a pleasure working so closely with him for a year and a half! He will outwork every person in the room period. Jon had various responsibilities throughout his time at Nowigence and handled all additions to his day to day operation with ease.  I genuinely hope I have the opportunity to work with him again in the future.'

			'I enjoyed greatly working with Jon P for over a year. While we handled different stacks of the application (me on Python backend, him on Node/JS), we collaborated on design of new projects that required delving into API (such as Microsoft OneDrive integration or GoogleDrive integration). What struck me was his fearless and optimistic attitude to tackling new problems, which is absolutely necessary when working on new things, especially in a start-up. I particularly valued his support and leadership, whether in managing a team of outside developers or researching ways to improve security of the application, or exploring new features of the next release of MongoDB. Perhaps more than his technical skills, I appreciated his people skills. Jon would be a great asset to any team he would join in the future. '

			"It's hard to find the words for how proud I am to know and to have had the pleasure to work with Jon.  He continuously shows his professionalism and ability to get work done in a timely manner while exceeding the goals set before not just himself, but his team as well.  He is constantly jumping in and putting out fires and not just fixing the problem (which is obviously important) but slowing down to walk you through it and make sure that you understand, and that you have a good grasp of how and why we needed to do something. I would work with Jon on any project and I certainly wouldn't hesitate to hire him. There are not enough good candidates as it is. I have zero doubt that Jonathan will be at the top of any team and bringing the entire organization up to such a high level of excellence right there with him. The bar for fantastic people to work with is ridiculously high. Jon, in my opinion, is very easily above and beyond that bar and will be a wonderful asset to any company or project that he is hired for."

			"Jon worked directly under me and was a phenominal teammate. We spun up an entire react native project to accompany a web project during a hackathon and had a fantastic time developing it.  I can say that he learns quickly and has a fantastic attitude even while facing new or challenging problems.  He works like a mad man!  I've never seen such a strong work ethic along with fantastic communication skills.  I look forward to working with him again in the future and feel confident in saying he will be a tremendous asset to any team!"

			'Jon was my Engineering manager at Nowigence.  He continuously helped out and assisted with development.  From looking into documentation for a few third-party integrations; to discussing the pros and cons of utilizing certain data structures and analyzing preformance.  He was a joy to work with and was very beneficial in keeping the team on track and hitting our deadlines.  He always had great feedback on pull requests and genuinely wanted to help everyone improve and develop stronger and cleaner code.  I look forward to working with Jon again in the future.'
